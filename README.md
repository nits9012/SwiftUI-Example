# SwiftUI-Example

If you are new in SwiftUI this example will help you to understand, how to make an API call and fetch JSON data in SwiftUI.

In this example, I have created a login screen. On successful login, it will display the list of all the countries with include country name, population, country code. 

For login please use below credentials
username : test@test.com
password : login

For fetching the countries I used the API from https://restcountries.eu website.
